    <h3>Self-improvement strategies</p>
    <ul>
      <p>READING</p>  
      <p>Reading is one of the most accessible and most affordable ways to expand our knowledge and our world. Books are great companions in our self-development journey, no matter what we want to improve.
      <p>JOURNALING</p>
      <p>Writing down thoughts helps us see them with more clarity. Keeping a journal with regularity lets us discover patterns and recurring ideas, and later on, we may decide to work on them. Another excellent tool for self-improvement is keeping a gratitude journal â€” that is, list every day at least a couple of things for which we are grateful. This leads to better self-awareness and self-esteem.
      <p>AFFIRMATIONS</p>
      <p>Affirmations are a powerful way to state our intentions and remind ourselves what we value. Daily affirmations let us deliberately focus on what we care about and bring more of it into our days.
      <p>PHYSICAL EXERCISE</p>  
      <p>Movement keeps us fit. The body is an excellent source of information, and it constantly signals us what it needs. Taking care of the body we live in is a beautiful way of taking care of ourselves and sustaining our development.  
      <p>CHOOSE YOUR WORDS</p>
      <p>Paying attention to our expressions and words may help a lot in shaping our daily life. Being mindful of what we say and how we say it is the first step to understanding ourselves better!
      <p>DO SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST TIME, GET OUT OF THE COMFORT ZONE!</p>  
      <p>Get out of your comfort zone and try out something new! One of my favorite questions to ask is, "When was the last time you did something for the first time?" It reminds me to explore, like children do, and to cultivate curiosity for the unknown. Embrace the discomfort cause if you want it, you gotta want it so bad. As bad as you want to breathe!
