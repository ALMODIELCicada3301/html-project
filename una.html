    <h2>What is self-improvement?:</p>
        <ul>
          <p>Self-improvement can be described as a life-long process. If we want to be at point Z at the end of our life, self-improvement is the process that makes us move from A to B to C… along with all the steps we need to reach our last stage and fulfill our life.</p>
    <br>      
            <p>The final stage is different for each of us, and the intermediate ones as well. But everyone can go through the process and experience the meaning — and the pleasure — of expanding oneself and enabling new stages to happen.</p>
    <br>
         <ul>
            <li>Self-improvement involves awareness, new learnings, discoveries about who we are and what makes us unique, and many insights and moments in which we see life and situations clearly.</li>
            <li>The process of continual development connects us deeply to our essence.</li>
            <li>Everyone who embarks on a self-improvement journey would say that the process is worth it, but it is messy and painful at times.</li>
            <li>To move forward and overcome our fears, we need to look at our shadows sometimes, and this may be scary.</li>
         </ul>
     <h3>What can we do to move forward when the game gets tough?</h3>
            <li>One of the keys to navigating growth is to remember why we are doing it and that what we are experiencing is normal, human, and an essential part of the journey.</li>
